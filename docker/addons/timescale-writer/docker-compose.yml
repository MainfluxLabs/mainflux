# This docker-compose file contains optional Timescale and Timescale-writer services
# for Mainflux platform. Since these are optional, this file is dependent of docker-compose file
# from <project_root>/docker. In order to run these services, execute command:
# docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml -f docker/addons/timescale-writer/docker-compose.yml up
# from project root. PostgreSQL default port (5432) is exposed, so you can use various tools for database
# inspection and data visualization.
