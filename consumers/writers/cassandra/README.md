## Deployment
The service itself is distributed as Docker container. Check the [`cassandra-writer`](https://github.com/MainfluxLabs/mainflux/blob/master/docker/addons/cassandra-writer/docker-compose.yml#L30-L49) service section in docker-compose to see how service is deployed.

To start the service, execute the following shell script:

```bash
# download the latest version of the service
git clone https://github.com/MainfluxLabs/mainflux

cd mainflux

# compile the cassandra writer
make cassandra-writer

# copy binary to bin
make install

# Set the environment variables and run the service
MF_BROKER_URL=[NATS instance URL] \
MF_CASSANDRA_WRITER_LOG_LEVEL=[Cassandra writer log level] \
MF_CASSANDRA_WRITER_PORT=[Service HTTP port] \
MF_CASSANDRA_WRITER_DB_CLUSTER=[Cassandra cluster comma separated addresses] \
MF_CASSANDRA_WRITER_DB_KEYSPACE=[Cassandra keyspace name] \

```

### Using docker-compose

This service can be deployed using docker containers. Docker compose file is
available in `<project_root>/docker/addons/cassandra-writer/docker-compose.yml`.
In order to run all Mainflux core services, as well as mentioned optional ones,
execute following command:

```bash
./docker/addons/cassandra-writer/init.sh
```

## Usage

Starting service will start consuming normalized messages in SenML format.
