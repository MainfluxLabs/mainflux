| MF_BROKER_URL                | Message broker instance URL                         | nats://localhost:4222 |
| MF_WS_ADAPTER_LOG_LEVEL      | Log level for the WS Adapter                        | error                 |
| MF_WS_ADAPTER_CLIENT_TLS     | Flag that indicates if TLS should be turned on      | false                 |
| MF_WS_ADAPTER_CA_CERTS       | Path to trusted CAs in PEM format                   |                       |

| MF_THINGS_AUTH_GRPC_TIMEOUT  | Things service Auth gRPC request timeout in seconds | 1s                    |

## Deployment

The service is distributed as Docker container. Check the [`ws-adapter`](https://github.com/MainfluxLabs/mainflux/blob/master/docker/docker-compose.yml#L350-L368) service section in docker-compose to see how the service is deployed.  

Running this service outside of container requires working instance of the message broker service.
To start the service outside of the container, execute the following shell script:

```bash
# download the latest version of the service
git clone https://github.com/MainfluxLabs/mainflux

cd mainflux

# compile the ws
make ws

# copy binary to bin
make install

# set the environment variables and run the service
MF_Broker_URL=[Message broker instance URL] \
MF_WS_ADAPTER_PORT=[Service WS port] \
MF_WS_ADAPTER_LOG_LEVEL=[WS adapter log level] \
MF_WS_ADAPTER_CLIENT_TLS=[Flag that indicates if TLS should be turned on] \
MF_WS_ADAPTER_CA_CERTS=[Path to trusted CAs in PEM format] \
MF_JAEGER_URL=[Jaeger server URL] \
MF_THINGS_AUTH_GRPC_URL=[Things service Auth gRPC URL] \
